# Coding Assessment Quiz - Tony Magrady

## README Author
Tony Magrady - Berkeley Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp student <br>
-- September 5, 2023

## Description
This is my portfolio page, which will be added to as the course progresses. <br>
Link to page: https://tonymagr.github.io/pro_portfolio/

This webpage "Project Portfolio" is a collection of my previous full-stack development work for <br>
prospective employers or customers to review and potentially make available employment or freelance <br>
opportunities.

HTML & CSS skills I learned while creating this website were:
- flexbox
- media queries
- CSS variables
- dry and inherited element attribute selection

## Challenges
I was not familiar with the relationship between flexboxes and flex items, which I learned in class <br>
and in the assignment. The deployed code on the web did not use its styling the first time, which I <br>
found was a case-sensitivity issue in the link to the stylesheet. This was not an issue in unit testing <br>
using the Open in Window command.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
Potential employers and customers can use this site to review my deployed portfolio of work samples. <br>
This is a primary resource for the employer or customer to assess my strengths and suitability for an <br>
open position or to contract for a freelance project.
